 👻 The Exorcism – First-Person Horror Game

**The Exorcism** is a first-person horror game built in Unity where players must explore, survive, and defeat a supernatural presence through a series of interactive puzzles and exorcism tools.

🧠 I personally designed, programmed, and built over 90% of the game — including mechanics, UI, visual effects, and level flow.
